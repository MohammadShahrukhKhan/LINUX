***Users Permissions***

ls -l (shows the list of directories with their permission state
i.e. for owner, for group and for others which means whether or not 
the root user can read, write and execute or whether a group can read, 
write and execute or if others can read, write and execute)

**Note**
-rwxrw-r-- represents the permission state of the file/folder

-rwx = read write execute, for owner
rw- = read write execute, for group
r-- = read write execute, for others

for the root user, let r = 1, w = 1 and x = 1,
so binary value = 111,
integer value of -rwx = 7

for a group, let r = 1, w = 1 and x = 0,
so binary value = 110,
integer value of rw- = 6

for others, let r = 1, w = 0 and x = 0,
so binary value = 100,
integer value of r-- = 4

*NOW*
to change the Users Permissions,
write in the terminal:

chmod 764 file_name/folder_name (changes the permissions 
according to the binary input)
