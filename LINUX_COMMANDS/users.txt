1. Regular User -> Having access only to his own home directory

2. Root User -> Having complete access to the system i.e. complete command over the system

3. Root User is also known as Super User or ADMIN

4. If a regular user gets a root access, then he can also have access to any other users directory 
   just by adding "sudo" before any command such as " sudo mkdir "

5. if he/she writes " sudo su " the system will automatically assume the user to be the root user but
   this practice is highly discouraged

6. Service User -> they have their own account who have got to do a service such as linux server & etc.
