1. Regular User -> User has access only to his own home directory

2. Root User -> User has complete access to the system i.e. root user has got complete command over the system

3. Root User is also known super User or ADMIN

4. If a regular user gets a root access , then he can get access to other users directory 
   just by adding "sudo" before any command such as " sudo mkdir "

5. if he writes " sudo su " the system will automatically assume the user to be root user but
   this is highly discouraged

6. Service User -> they have their own account who have got to do a service such linux server etc.
