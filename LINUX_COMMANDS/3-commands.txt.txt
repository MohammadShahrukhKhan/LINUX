***Users Permissions***

ls -l -> gives the list of directories with their permission state
i.e. for owner, for group and for others which means whether or not 
user can read, write and execute or whether group can read, write and execute 
or if others can read, write and execute

rwx = read write execute, for owner
rwx = read write execute, for group
rwx = read write execute, for others

for owner let binary(r = 1, w = 1, x = 1),
integer value of rwx = 7

for group let binary(r = 1, w = 1, x = 0),
integer value of rw- = 6

for others let binary(r = 1, w = 0, x = 0),
integer value of r-- = 4

*NOW*
to change the Users Permissions,
write in the terminal:

chmod 764 file_or_folder_name -> gives -rwxrw-r-- and changes the permissions 
according to the binary input

**Remember**
-rwxrw-r-- shows the permission state of the file or folder
