
Run these commands in your linux terminal:

ls -R (lists the directories and the sub-directories within the present workimg directory)
here R stands for recursive

touch .hidden_file_name (creates a hidden file (must add dot "." before file name))

ls -a (shows the hidden files along with non-hidden files)

ls -r (sorts the folder names from Z to A)

ls -t (sorts the file by modification time, showing the last edited file first)

clear (clears the terminal)

history (shows all the recent commands typed in the terminal)

echo it in the terminal (add "echo" before a sentence to write it in the terminal)

printf "a sentence" (this command is used to print a sentence)

printf "a sentence in a new line\n" (this command is used to print a sentence in a new line)

sudo apt install name_of_software (to install a software in the system)

***IMPORTANT: one.txt & ONE.txt are different i.e. a slight change can creates a big difference
because linux has case sensitivity with naming***
